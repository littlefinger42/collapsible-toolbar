# collapsible-toolbar
Native JavaScript Collapsible Toolbar. More buttons can be added by adding additional anchor tags with a [data-setting] attribute to the html. The JavaScipt calculates the setting toolbar's children from counting the [data-setting] elements.

I've implemented media queries to this element, so when the screen width is below 768px, the settings toolbar collapses. It also reduces in size.

Feel free to use this wherever/however you want.

## Todo:
1. Make accessible by resolving tabindex and adding appropiate ARIA tags.
2. Slim contradicting CSS
3. Fill setting items with example icons
